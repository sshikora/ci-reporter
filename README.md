# ci-reporter

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that report ci errors in pr&#x27;s

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## The challenge

After learning about Probot, I wanted to get it working with a Continuous Integration tool like SemephoreCI or CircleCI.

The first challenge was to get webhooks running with local code. At first I thought a separate server would be needed, so I spent time setting that up with a separate server that would emit the hooks, before I realized that you could use a service to do the same thing.

Building a Probot app was very confusing as it wasn't clear from the documentation how to connect the local app to the webhook events. Finding all the events, their fields, what triggered them and why was also not straight forward. I started with CircleCI but wasn't able get CircleCI to emit correct events, so I switched to SemaphoreCI which did.

Next steps are to get a few other more interesting versions of this app, that work to pull the branch and build info from the event context, pull PR and success/error data from SemaphoreCI, and pull that all to build better comment text. There are some differences on how the SemaphoneCI api is documented and how it works in practice which I have to work through.
